# Soft_Knee_Exoskeleton
My thesis for Soft Knee exoskeleton using Twisted Elastic Actuators
Traditionally exoskeletons and primarily lower limb exoskeletons have always been rigid, i.e using rigid motors and valves for actuation
However, rigid exoskeletons come with the disadvantage of bulkiness and inability to wear in the public comfortably.
This research tries to make exoskeltons more compact and human like by incorportaing soft muscles as actuators. 
The soft muscles visioned to use here are Twisted elastic actuators. 

# Twisted elastic actuators 
A modification in traditional Twisted string actuators by replacing the rigid string material with a soft and elastic material 
The intution behind the change can be explained by the following 
Variable Stiffness (Active/Controllable Compliance): 
The twisting action can be used to actively modulate the stiffness of the elastic cord, allowing the actuator to adapt its mechanical impedance to the task or environment.

**Superior Force Control:**
The inherent compliance of the elastic element acts as a Series Elastic Element, which dramatically improves the stability and precision of force control, especially in tasks involving human-robot interaction.

**High Impact Tolerance:** 
The elastic cord absorbs and dissipates sudden external shocks and impact loads (like collisions), protecting the motor, gearbox, and rigid drivetrain components from damage.

**Energy Storage and Release:**
The elastic material stores potential energy, which can be strategically released to improve peak power output or enhance the efficiency of dynamic, cyclic motions (like in jumping or oscillating systems).

**Reduced Drivetrain Wear:**
By absorbing shock and dampening vibrations, the elastic element reduces wear and tear on the motor and gearhead, increasing the overall lifespan of the rigid components.

We have carried out tests to examine the force output with respect to the number of turns of actuation and number of strings using our setup
